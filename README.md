"HackerRank is a tech company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications. HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains." I will be providing my responses to these challenges in hopes of keeping a record of my progression in various programming languages.
As a student and a professional, I recommend not using these answers for the sake of copying and pasting. I encourage those who may be struggling to find optimal forms of studying either by additional courses or tutoring.
